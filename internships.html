				Teresa Academy

			<p>
				I worked in Teresa Academy, a school associated with Maiti Nepal. I assisted the upper-kindergarten teacher in creating projects, taking care of and teaching the children. I handled tasks such as decorating the classroom, grading notebooks, teaching nursery rhymes, and teaching English to the students. As an assistant teacher, my main job was to create a safe environment for the students who either came from underprivileged households or were victims of human trafficking.
