                        	The potential of data to support society is unmatched and my interests and education have taught me that in a globalizing community, data is a necessary tool to create national and international cooperation and awareness. My name is Sneha Verma and I am a Data Science and Economics junior at Luther College. I believe that data can and should be used to solve social problems, create informed policies, promote transparency and social awareness, and innovate. 
                        </p>
						<p>
							I am from India and have lived in six countries over a period of 17 years. I have been introduced to a multitude of cultures, beliefs, and academic curriculums. An important lesson that I have learned from the experience of living in different countries and meeting people with varying backgrounds is that diversity is not to be feared, it is to be revered and accepted; differences are not meant to demean, rather be learned from and appreciated. In a world that is connected through technology but divided because of beliefs, I believe that data can be used in all fields and industries to bridge the gap between ignorance and awareness, between fear and reverence. My interest in economics fosters my passion for using data to solve existing problems, to create policies that help organizations and governments create data-backed policies, efficient and necessary products and services, and create a transparent environment between people of authority and the public.

						I work on minor projects, such as updating DC current documents to reflect 2021 developments. I sit in on community trainings and mobilizations to learn about the process of creating training programs and curriculums that can be taught in schools and organizations. I work with the DC Tech Support to create efficient operating methods, using Power Automate, in MS SharePoint to increase ease of transactions and record-keeping for the members of the Diversity Council.

	                    As a media relations assistant, I wrote press releases about Luther College in Associated Press (AP) style and distribute them with accuracy. I was also responsible to research avenues for press releases and media pitches and communicating with the Luther community to gather information. I tracked media placements of Luther College and managed the department's email account. My primary job was to work with news media organizations, such as newspapers, television, radio, magazines, blogs, etc., to get the word out about Luther and drive awareness and enrollment.

						I wrote press releases highlighting the achievements of Luther students, staff, and faculty members by communicating with members of the institution to receive reliable information. As a student worker, I was responsible to find and research stories and communicate with people to spread awareness. I wrote more than 10 press releases over a variety of topics and helped spread the word through friends and faculty connections.

	                    As a Career Peer Advisor, I supported and encouraged fellow students throughout their career process from developing self-awareness to internship and job searches, to crafting resumes and cover letters and preparing for interviews. I also assisted the office staff with projects that involved keeping records of various events and workshops. Further, I designed and helped implement student work development and contributed to the diversity, equity, and inclusion of the department. I also handled the website and social media accounts along with acting as a liaison to affinity groups.

						I looked over 20 resumes to help students of all grade levels apply for internships and have had numerous meetings to do the same. The Career Center Instagram and Facebook accounts reached over 300% more engagement and people are interacting with the Career Center more through social media. I created picture posts, IGTV videos, and stories for the Career Center to promote the department's services.

	                    As the office assistant, I helped in conducting pedagogical research and organise events, workshops, and meetings for faculty development. Further, I completed administrative tasks around the office, such as updating information on speaker events, workshop attendance, and one-on-one conferences with the CELT director. I also collected data to understand and assist in the improvement of teaching methods across campus. I acted as a liaison to other departments to receive data and conduct researches to inform and better teaching practices at Luther. Data collected include those from surveys and research.

						I worked on creating content for the CELT department, such as efforts to aid professors to adjust to the needs of the pandemic, creating content for and editing the CELT website by editing recorded videos of professors sharing their teaching techniques. I created multiple CELT videos, and I analyzed student surveys to create data spreadsheets to inform professors about the effectiveness of their teaching techniques leading to an increase in the traffic to the CELT website.

	                <p>
	                    The research, with Dr. Samuel Bird, studies economic decision-making in the context of agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, one of the most important economic sectors and regions for economic development. In particular, the project studies whether the decision of harvesting method differs between men and women within a household. This project adds to the research of decision-making models in the agricultural fields while investigating gender norms under an economic view.

						For this research, I collected the data and cleaned it with the Stata 16 software. Further, I conducted exploratory data analysis through Stata do-files. I created data visualizations and tables to demonstrate the variance and skewness of the variables and to display the final analysis results obtained through multiple linear regression. The results are documented on a data appendix created by the Stata Markdown language.

						I took part in the hiring process by reviewing applications, conducting interviews, and recommending changes to the managers. Projects I have participated in include scheduling fun activities to boost morale, creating a semester-long game to create a fun environment during work, and managing the department's social media handles.

						I created content for the Technology Help Desk Instagram and Twitter accounts, such as Tech Tips and Techie Tuesdays, to increase student engagement with the department. Post engagement increased by 20% and followers increased by 10%.
