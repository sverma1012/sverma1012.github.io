                        	The potential of data to support society is unmatched and my interests and education have taught me that in a globalizing community, data is a necessary tool to create national and international cooperation and awareness. My name is Sneha Verma and I am a Data Science and Economics junior at Luther College. I believe that data can and should be used to solve social problems, create informed policies, promote transparency and social awareness, and innovate. 
                        </p>
						<p>
							I am from India and have lived in six countries over a period of 17 years. I have been introduced to a multitude of cultures, beliefs, and academic curriculums. An important lesson that I have learned from the experience of living in different countries and meeting people with varying backgrounds is that diversity is not to be feared, it is to be revered and accepted; differences are not meant to demean, rather be learned from and appreciated. In a world that is connected through technology but divided because of beliefs, I believe that data can be used in all fields and industries to bridge the gap between ignorance and awareness, between fear and reverence. My interest in economics fosters my passion for using data to solve existing problems, to create policies that help organizations and governments create data-backed policies, efficient and necessary products and services, and create a transparent environment between people of authority and the public.

							For this research, I collected the data and cleaned it with the Stata 16 software. Further, I conducted exploratory data analysis through Stata do-files. I created data visualizations and tables to demonstrate the variance and skewness of the variables and to display the final analysis results obtained through multiple linear regression. The results are documented on a data appendix created by the Stata Markdown language.

	                        		Through this project, I wanted to analyze the effects of race, gender, and financial status on the chances of graduating from a Midwestern Liberal Arts college. A further consideration of this proejct is to combine these factors into one model to understand the effect of interaction terms on the chances to graduate, such as being an Asian female from a low-income status or a Black male from high-income status.

	                        		We started by conducting basic exploration and transformations of the features to account for skewness. Then, we conducted backward elimination and applied a first-order model to see which variables are significant and found out that hepatitis B is not a significant variable. To make a more reliable and a better predictive model, we conducted step-wise regression on centered interaction efects between all variables. We found out that many of the interaction efects of the variables are significant proving that certain health factors have an infuence on life expectancy of a nation dependent on another health factor. However, our data set has a few clusters for various variables that also have large residuals and/or leverage points (points that have a large infuence suggesting that we should consider diferent transformations for these variables. Hence, while we have used the AIC criterion to make our predictive model more reliable, we would suggest conducting a few more tests and transformations to account for high leverage and residual points.

										The project was completed in Python using Jupyter Notebook. We began with exploratory data analysis looking at the variables, their distributions, and any anomalies like missing or duplicate values. We looked at correlation between the independent and dependent variables to understand possible impactful factors. The next step was to scrub the data and deal with all the anomalies, one-hot encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features. The third and last step of the process was to analyze and mdoel the data. We applied Decision Tree and KNN classification on the training and test sets to measure the predictive abilities of both these models. We found that the KNN classifier is the better model based on the applied metrics.

										We started by conducting basic exploration of each of the variables to understand if there were any skewness that needed to be dealt with. There was low to moderate skewness but it was not of a large concern due to which we did not conduct any transformations on our variables. Then, we conducted a first-order model to see which variables are signficant and found that all variables except entropy are signficant in determining if the image is of a real or fake banknote. After this, we conducted step-wise regression and got similar results because of which we added interaction effects and did stepwise regression with the AIC criterion and found that the interaction between variance and entropy, and kurtosis and entropy are significant at a 0.05 level. It appears that our model is a close-to-perfect fit of the dataset because it has linearity, as checked from model diagnostics, and high sensitivity and specificity rates indicating that its predictive powers is high. Further, the area under the ROC curve is close to 1 (0.9998), further confirmation of the modelâ€™s perfect fitness. There are points that have high leverage values and there is one point that has a high Cookâ€™s distance value. For further investigation, we would suggest looking at these points to understand how we can deal with them.

										The project was completed in Python using Jupyter Notebook. We began with exploratory data analysis looking at the variables, their distributions (using waffle charts), and any anomalies like missing or duplicate values. We looked at correlation between the independent and dependent variables to understand possible impactful factors. The next step was to scrub the data and deal with all the anomalies, one-hot encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features. We created two sets of training and test sets: with and without outlers and created dashboards to visualize the effects of removing the outliers on the model. The third and last step of the process was to analyze and mdoel the data. We applied multiple linear and polynomial regression to both sets of training and test data to find that the polynomial regression with outlers have better predictive ability.
