				My first project was my high-school senior year project where we were required to engage in some issue that interested us and produce a product that related to it. I decided to make a website to show the importance and necessity of women in STEM. This is how my interest in engaging in projects began.

			<h2>
				Building a website
			</h2>

			<p>
				Description: I started this project in December 2016 and ended it in April 2017. Through online courses and tutorial books, I learned web programming languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, my knoweldge was preliminary and the website I built reflected that. Yet, the purpose of this project was to show that even a cursory knolwedge of these languages can allow a person (anyone, not just men) to create a powerful website for various purposes.
				<p>
					Result: A website that showed my knowledge
				</p>
				<p>
					Achievements: Learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript
				</p>

			<h2>
				Creating videos on the importance of forgiveness
			</h2>
			<p>
				Description: Forgiveness is often a skill or quality taken for granted. However, as learned during a class during my first-year of college, the ability of forgiving does not come easily and can often be the cause of physical and mental health issues. Through this project, my teammates and I explored ways of motivating people to forgive and move on.
				<p>
					Result: Two YouTube videos briefly introducing people to the idea of forgiveness
				</p>
				<p>
					Achievements: Worked upon my video editing skills and spread the knowledge learned in college
				</p>
