				Location: Luther College, Decorah, Iowa. Luther is a private liberal arts college in a small town in Iowa. It supports the education and interest of all students through various co-curricular activities, diverse majors, study-abroad programs, and work opportunities.

				I worked as a economics research student during the summer of 2020. The process called for professor-student collaboration, and was competitive and application-based. The selected were awarded a montary grant to conduct the research and the student was awarded a stipend for the duration of the research. The aim of the grant was to encourage students to participate in the research process under the guidance of a faculty member and to gain experience in their field of interest. The grant was awarded to professors and students that exemplified this goal. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The project studied economic decision-making in the context of agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, one of the most important economic sectors and regions for economic development. In particular, the project aimed to study the question of whether the decision to sell crops differs between men and women within a household. The project adds to the research of decision-making models in the agricultural fields while investigating gender norms under an economic view.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the research student, I collected data from the World Bank library regrading agricultural decisions and output in Uganda. Further, I preprocessed the datasets using the Stata software. Throughout this process, I documented my actions and results in a research log. The analysis of the preprocessed data led to the creation of a data appendix using the Markdown language with Stata. This part of the research process gave me the opportunity to learn a new language compatible with Stata and how to record the results of a research. Throughout the research, I gained professional experience as an economics and data science student, as well as opportunities of personal growth through the patience required while cleaning multiple datasets.
