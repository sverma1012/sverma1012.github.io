				I volunteered as an assistant teacher in the upper-kindergarten class. Through this experience, I gained the experience of interacting with people from a different culture, a different economic background, and with different experiences. Further, I developed my leadership and creativity skills.
			</p>
			<p>
				Teresa Academy accepts underprivileged children and victims of human trafficking rescued by Maiti Nepal. Through the experience of working with these students, I developed skills and gained knowledge regarding culture, sensitivity, leadership, and sympathy.  
			</p>
			<p>
				As an assistant teacher, it was my responsibility to take care of the students in the absence of the teacher. I taught the students nursery rhymes in Hindi and English, and graded their tests and hiomework for all subjects. Further, I created various projects for the classroom, such as an interactive calendar, a drawing labelled with body parts, and a poster with pictures and names of animals, in an attempt to create an accepting and educational setting for the students.
