				Location: SAPNA is a NGO that helps the underprivileged and poor of the society by providing them with education, healthcare, and empowerment.They have support centers in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India and Alwar, Rajasthan, India.

		<div class="subsection gray">
			<p>
				I interned in the AIIMS Hospital office of SAPNA. Through this internship, I gained administrative knowledge and learned about the dire financial problems that many people in India face. Through this experience, I have gained knowledge regarding finances, leadership, administration, and medicine.
			</p>
			<p>
				SAPNA accept interns from across the world for a period of two months or more. Their New Delhi focusses on healthcare while their Alwar office focusses on education and women empowerment. Through this internship, I truly felt like I contributed to the society that I am a part of. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As an intern, it was my responsibility to take care of the documents and files of the office, such as noting the donations made and the spending done under the name of the organization. Further, I went to serve food to the people of the Dharamshala, a place where sickly people resided and I took care of the needs of the patients inside the hospital, such as providing tootpaste, blankets, clothes etc. to create a bond with the patients so that they could rely on the organization.
