				Blogs are a method through which people can express their opinions and experiences. They are multipurpose with uses extending to educational or personal purposes. Blogs allow poeple to reach a certain kind of audience where their messages would be most impactful or heard. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By deciding to write blogs, I have chosen to make some of my opinions, knowledge, and experiences heard by a larger audience. This is not to raise a voice against an existing paradigm in society, but rather to create my own paradigm.

				Teresa Academy
			</h2>

			<p>
				I worked in Teresa Academy, a school associated with Maiti Nepal. I assisted the upper-kindergarten teacher in creating projects, taking care of and teaching the children. I handled tasks such as decorating the classroom, grading notebooks, teaching nursery rhymes, and teaching English to the students. As an assistant teacher, my main job was to create a safe environment for the students who either came from underprivileged households or were victims of human trafficking.
